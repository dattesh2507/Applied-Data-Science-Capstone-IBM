# :rocket: Applied-Data-Science-Capstone-IBM


## Introduction

In this capstone, we will predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch. 


This capstone project course will give you a taste of what data scientists go through in real life when working with real datasets. You will assume the role of a Data Scientist working for a startup intending to compete with SpaceX, and in the process follow the Data Science methodology involving [data collection](https://github.com/dattesh2507/Applied-Data-Science-Capstone-IBM/blob/main/spacex-data-collection-api.ipynb),[data wrangling](https://github.com/dattesh2507/Applied-Data-Science-Capstone-IBM/blob/main/spacex-Data%20wrangling.ipynb) ,[exploratory data analysis](https://github.com/dattesh2507/Applied-Data-Science-Capstone-IBM/blob/main/EDA%20with%20Visualization.ipynb), [data visualization](https://github.com/dattesh2507/Applied-Data-Science-Capstone-IBM/blob/main/Launch%20Sites%20Locations%20Analysis%20with%20Folium.ipynb), [model evaluation](https://github.com/dattesh2507/Applied-Data-Science-Capstone-IBM/blob/main/SpaceX_Machine%20Learning%20Prediction.ipynb)and [reporting](https://github.com/dattesh2507/Applied-Data-Science-Capstone-IBM/blob/main/winning%20space%20race%20with%20data%20science.pdf) your results to stakeholders. You are tasked with predicting if the first stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully. 




## :page_facing_up: Project Background
SpaceX is the most successful company of the commercial space 
age, making space travel affordable. The company advertises Falcon 
9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; 
other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the 
savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore, if we 
can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost 
of a launch. Based on public information and machine learning 
models, we are going to predict if SpaceX will reuse the first stage.
## :page_facing_up: Questions to be answered 
- How do variables such as payload mass, launch site, number of 
flights, and orbits affect the success of the first stage landing? 
- Does the rate of successful landings increase over the years? 
- What is the best algorithm that can be used for binary classification 
in this case?
## :page_facing_up: Methodology
  ### 1. Data collection methodology
  - Using SpaceX Rest API
  - Using Web Scrapping from Wikipedia
  ### 2. Performed data wrangling
  - Filtering the data
  - Dealing with missing values
  - Using One Hot Encoding to prepare the data to a binary classification
  ### 3. Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) using visualization and SQL
  ### 4. Performed interactive visual analytics using Folium and Plotly Dash
  ### 5. Performed predictive analysis using classification models
  - Building, tuning and evaluation of classification models to ensure the best
  results
